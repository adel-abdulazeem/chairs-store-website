## Lessons Learned:
How to implement Bootstrap for styling the UI and making the UX much more better.
configuration of mongoose Schema to accept nested arrays of documents withing array and how to populate those documents 
How to display the count of the selected items in the cart by using computeCountItems function and fixing the bug when logging out by applying a conditionals that handle such scenario or case, I got stuck for days not too much but about 3 or 4 days till I figured out to handle and resolve based on my analytical logic on what I'm facing after trying many different methods such as googling, searching and reading through articles to get access to someone's experience with such problem but that doesn't work, then I get to the concept that I can depend on what I know and my software skill based on the simple rule that the computer will do what you tell it to do so my I applied my analytical logic beside my knowledge and experience to get the job done and finally I've did it and that's a big win that's I'm so proud of and give me that awesome rewarding feeling of getting through and overcoming struggle and being confident that I can get it done whatever how difficult the challenge I'm going through.
